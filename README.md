# Intro

This is a demo of a React website offering trip deals. There is no backend component as the work focused on implementing the frontend part only. 

## Pre-requisites

When running this app locally make sure you have `node` and `npm` available in your environment. 

To install dependencies, use

### `npm install`

This will install all of the dependencies necessary to run the project specified in `package.json`.

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
